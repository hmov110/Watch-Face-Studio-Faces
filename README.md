# Watch-Face-Studio-Faces
Watch faces in Watch Face Studio for Wear OS Devices

Recreations of watchfaces that I used in Watchmaker.  With an upgrade to a Galaxy 7 watch and Wear OS updates, Watchmaked stopped working.  I have recreated several of the watches I used to use in watch face format in Watch Face Studio (Samsung).  As a Disney fan, most of these are Disney related watches originally downloaded and used in Watchmaker.  I did not create most of these, though a few, I did.  Most are recreations of watched collected over a fairly long period of time!
